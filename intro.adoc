== Introduction

RVM-CSI (Risc-V eMbedded - Common Software Interface) has been defined with the aim of facilitating the portability
of source code across different embedded platforms.

RVM refers to a class of _platforms_ and _profiles_ which RISC-V International intends to define. A profile defines
a specific base ISA, plus ISA extensions and any options applicable within those ISA extensions. A platform comprises
a profile plus further specifications for non-ISA features (such as interrupt controllers etc.).

One possible motivation behind defining these profiles and platforms is to constrain the features of a RISC-V
platform in order to make it easier to write software that is portable between platforms. This is most important in
the application processor space, where binary distributions need to be created that will work on platforms from
multiple vendors. Hence most focus in this area has been on the RVA (application processor) platforms.

In the embedded space, the definition of profiles and platforms is not motivated by binary software portability.
Rather, since we assume that software will be built for a specific embedded platform, we can deal with the problem
of software portability by creating a software layer that abstracts the features of the platform. Hence the motivation
behind RVM-CSI.

In constructing systems for RVM platforms, we assume the following:

* The software is built for a specific platform (i.e., platform characteristics are known at build time).
* The software is not using a rich OS such as Linux (which would have its own standardized methods for control
of the platform and discovery of its characteristics).

It is important to note that a platform does not need to conform to a defined RVM platform in order to support RVM-CSI.

Most importantly, RVM-CSI Specifies:

* The API (Application Programming Interface) for a _Hardware Abstraction Layer_ (HAL).  Board vendors can produce
_Board Support Packs_ (BSPs) conforming to this API, and application writers can write their code against the interface
in order to create portable code.
* The format of Board Support Packs.

The API aims to have no dependency on certain features being present in the platform (beyond the base ISA).  Any run-time
functionality that depends on certain hardware characteristics can either a) report the absence of the required
functionality and hence be non-functional, or b) emulate the required functionality in software.

While the first version of the specification deals with a C language API, future enhancements may encompass other
languages.  Implementations in different languages will share common function names and descriptions wherever possible.

* RVM-CSI *_API definition_*: a language-specific, platform-agnostic programming interface that is used by
application writers. indexterm:[API definition]
* *_Application writers_*: users of the API, writing code which is portable between platforms.

* *_Board Support Pack_* (BSP): a package containing the platform-specific code implementing the
functionality in the API. (This could also be implemented within a language runtime). indexterm:[Board Support Pack]

=== Assumed Features of Underlying Hardware

==== Privilege Levels

We assume that systems targeted by RVM-CSI will require either Machine-mode only, or Machine mode + User mode.
No functionality is provided to target Hypervisor, Supervisor or VS privilege modes.

==== Virtual Memory

RVM-CSI does not support virtual addressing.

== HAL APIs Overview

RVM-CSI supplies run-time APIs for general-purpose hardware abstraction on 3 complimentary levels:

* *Low-level* (file prefix: csi_ll_): These APIs will wrap specific pieces of hardware within a RISC-V platform,
providing a convenient way to control that hardware from a high-level language. The hardware covered may include
both standard aspects of a RISC-V core and peripherals. The APIs should aim to offer access to all the
functionality within the hardware itself. They will not always be portable to other implementations of the same
class of hardware.
* *Driver-level* (file prefix: csi_dl_): These will be platform-agnostic APIs aiming to offer functionality that
requires interaction with hardware peripherals; specified in a way that abstracts the implementation details of
the actual peripherals present in the platform. These APIs should be designed with a focus on creating peripheral
drivers that will work across multiple different RISC-V platforms; including drivers for an RTOS.
Driver-level APIs will typically use the low-level APIs in their implementation.
* *High-level* (file prefix: csi_hl_): These will be APIs at a higher level of abstraction offering a more convenient
way for a user application to interact with platform hardware, particularly aimed at bare-metal systems or systems
with a very thin OS such as FreeRTOS.  High-level APIs will typically use both driver-level and low-level APIs
in their implementation.  The functionality offered here may overlap with that offered by some operating systems.

The APIs on these 3 levels are not software _layers_: they are offered as modules that can be optionally combined
in any way desired.

All of the code underneath these RVM-CSI APIs is considered to be platform-specific, and would typically be
provided as a Board Support Package (BSP) by a platform vendor. However in practice, much of the code, particularly
at driver-level and high-level, can be formed from common code with a few build-time options to tailor its behaviour
to the platform. This makes implementation of a BSP for a new platform much easier. The use of the low-level API
to provide platform-specific information (such as addresses) to the driver-level code in a standard form helps
to facilitate this.

In systems that use an OS, the RVM-CSI APIs are designed to sit "underneath" the OS or are otherwise complimentary
to it.  There is no intention to abstract the functionality of the OS itself.

The following diagram illustrate how these APIs might fit within a user application which makes use of an RTOS:
