  - name: Trap Handling / Interrupt and Timer Support
    description: >
      This module provides functionality for routing interrupts and registering handlers for traps,
      controlling the system timer, and managing timed events.
      The BSP provides base trap handler functionality, which is installed when the initialization function
      csi_interrupts_init is called.  This base trap handling code provides save and restore of register context,
      performs default exception handling, and calls any handlers registered by the user.
      Systems using RVM-CSI may provide their own trap handling
      support, in which case csi_interrupts_init should not be called, and all functions in this module
      will be inoperative.
    notes:
      - There will be at most one instance of the trap handling and interrupt subsystem per hart.
      - >
        The base trap handler will attempt to inform users of unhandled exceptions via the RVM-CSI console
        API.  Other unhandled interrupts will be ignored.
      - >
        The base trap handler will deal with saving and restoring all registers which would normally be used
        by compiled C code without the use of special compiler intrinsics (the exact register set is platform-dependent
        and may be documented by the BSP). Other registers manipulated by the user's handler (such as
        platform-specific CSRs etc.) should be saved and restored by that handler.
      - >
        It is the responsibility of the user's handler to clear down the source of any interrupt that it is
        handling, prior to returning.
      - >
        BSP implementations of the functions within this module should be thread-safe.  The use of separate
        context spaces for each hart protects against multiple cores simultaneously running a function.
        To ensure that the code is reentrant in systems with multiple software-scheduled threads, the
        implementation should turn off interrupts temporarily, to prevent re-scheduling, while accessing
        data within the context space, as required.
      - >
        BSPs should use vectored interrupts where possible; although to save memory, handlers
        for many different mcause values may share code.

        Read the current timer value.  This function can be called from M-mode or U-mode.  However,
        on systems where the timer is not directly readable from U-mode, the function will have to
        ECALL to M-mode to make the read, which will likely make the value innaccurate due to the
        delay incurred by this.
