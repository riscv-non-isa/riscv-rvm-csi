== The C HAL API

=== General Principles

==== Discovery of Fixed Platform Characteristics at Run-time

Since we assume that code is built for a specific platform, it is undesirable to use function-calls (rather than
macros) to discover fixed platform characteristics; since this constitutes an unnecessary overhead.  However, there
may be circumstances where a BSP implementation wishes to supply code for this purpose.  For this reason, APIs for discovery
of some fixed platform characteristics have been implemented to look like a function call.  The assumption is that
in most cases these function calls can be optimized out by the compiler, leaving no overhead.

==== Distribution in Binary or Source Code Form

BSPs may be supplied either as source code, which the user builds into their system, or as a pre-built binary library.
To support the latter case, pre-processor directives that are intended to change BSP behaviour (as listed in
<<Global Definitions Set By Application Writers>>) must only be used in header files, not within the compiled C-code.

==== Thread Safety

All API functions shall be implemented in a way that supports simultaneous calls from multiple cores or software threads.
This is supported through the use of an initialisation function which allocates a separate context space for each instance.

=== Header Files

"Top-level" header files which would normally be included by application writers are indicated in bold in the table
below.  Others listed here are included from the top-level ones.

[cols="2,1,5",options="header"]
|===
|Header|Supplied by|Contents
|csi_types.h|API|General-purpose definitions such as return codes, included from many other headers.
|*csi_ll.h*|API|Low-level HAL API
|csi_ll_csrs.h|API|Standard CSR definitions (auto-generated according to the RISC-V spec)
|csi_ll_bsp_csrs.h|BSP|Custom CSR definitions
|csi_ll_bsp_perip.h|BSP|Peripheral register definitions
|csi_hl_interrupt_sources.h|API|Enumeration of standard interrupt sources
|csi_hl_bsp_interrupts.h|BSP|Enumeration of platform-specific interrupt sources in the system
|csi_ll_bsp_defs.h|BSP|Required macros to supplied by the BSP, picked up inline functions within API headers.
|*csi_hl_interrupts.h*|API|High-level interrupt and timer API
|===

All header files must be protected against multiple inclusion, by means of a define which takes the form of a capitalised version
of the file name, with special characters replaced by underscores.  For example a header file
csi_ll_bsp_csrs.h will have contents of the form:
[source, c]
----
#ifndef CSI_LL_BSP_CSRS_H
#define CSI_LL_BSP_CSRS_H

// ... file contents

#endif // CSI_LL_BSP_CSRS_H
----

=== Definitions set by BSPs

The following macros must be defined by BSP authors and exposed in the specified header files:

==== Context Sizes

Some modules within the API will require a context space allocated via an initialisation function.
BSPs will publish macros defining the required size of each such context space in bytes, either
in csi_ll_bsp_defs.h or in the same header as the associated initialisation function.

==== CSRs (Control and Status Registers)

csi_ll_csrs.h lists indices and bitfield information for all the standard RISC-V CSRs.  This file will be
auto-generated from the repo https://github.com/riscv/riscv-opcodes, which acts as a Single Source of Truth
for this information.  Accordingly, the contents will align with 
https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim/blob/master/riscv/encoding.h (which forms part of the
spike simulator).

In addition, csi_ll_bsp_csrs.h should enumerate all custom CSR names, addresses and bit-fields in a similar way.
Custom CSR indices are prefixed CCSR_.  Bit shifts for fields within custom CSRs are prefixed CCSR_SHIFT_, and
masks for bitfields within custom CSRs are prefixed CCSR_MASK_.

==== Peripheral Registers

csi_ll_bsp_perip.h should publish macros listing all peripheral register names, addresses and bit-fields.

Peripheral register address definitions are prefixed PERIP_.  Shifts and masks for bit-fields within those
registers are prefixed PERIP_SHIFT_ and PERIP_MASK_ respectively.

==== Interrupts

csi_hl_interrupt_sources.h enumerates a set of standard interrupt sources, such as system timer, and hardware-generated exceptions.

csi_hl_bsp_interrupts.h should enumerate all platform-specific interrupts in the system, giving them unique identification numbers
that follow on from the interrupt numbers in csi_hl_interrupt_sources.h.

The numerical values of these enumerations bear no relationship to hardware; they are simply unique numbers assigned
arbitrarily to the interrupt sources, allowing them to be indexed by the software.  The enumerations are prefixed INT_.

csi_hl_bsp_interrupts.h should also define the following macros and types:

[cols="4,2,6",options="header"]
|===
|Definition|Type|Purpose
|CSI_MAX_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY|Macro|Number of of non-zero interrupt priorities available.
|CSI_MAX_INTERRUPT_LEVEL|Macro|Number of non-zero interrupt levels available, or 0 if interrupt levels are not supported.
|CSI_INTERRUPT_MCTX_MIN_SIZE_BYTES|Macro|Minimum size of M-mode context space for interrupt sub-system.
|csi_timeout_t|struct|Context structure associated with a timeout.
|===

(Note: interrupt priorities determine the order in which simultaneous interrupts at a given privilege level are handled,
while interrupt levels determine which interrupts can preempt others, if supported: see interrupts module for details).

=== Global Definitions Set By Application Writers

The following macros may be defined globally by application writers, in order to change the behaviour of the underlying BSP code:

[cols="3,2,6",options="header"]
|===
|Macro|Possible values|Purpose
|CSI_UPRINT_OUTPUT|NONE / SEMIHOST / UART / CIRCBUFF
a|Determines the text output mode of the csi_uprintf function.

* NONE=function has no effect;
* SEMIHOST=function routes to semihosting if available;
* UART=function routes to UART;
* CIRCBUF=function routes to circular buffer.

See csi_uprintf description for details.  If the macro is undefined,
behaviour defaults to SEMIHOST, in which case behaviour is undefined if a semihosting mechanism is unavailable.
|CSI_LOG_LEVEL|ERR / WARN / INFO / NONE|Determines the behaviour of the macros CSI_LOG_ERR, CSI_LOG_WARN and
CSI_LOG_INFO.  See documentation of these macros for details.
