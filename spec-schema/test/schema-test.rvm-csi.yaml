    description: >
      This header should not be included directly by users.  Rather, users include
      <platform_name>.h, which is supplied by a Board Support Pack (BSP) for a specific
      platform.  This in turn includes a series of platform-specific headers culminating
      in this common one.

          Registers a user-supplied function <code>isr</code>that will be called by the base trap handler on receipt
          of a trap arising from a given signal
        c-specific-notes:
          - >
            This function uses the CSI base trap handler so is surrounded by <code>#ifndef CUSTOM_BASE_TRAP_HANDLER</code>.
            It transparently deals with routing the desired signal to the hart and enabling the interrupt
            (by internally calling <code>cs_route_signal()</code>).
